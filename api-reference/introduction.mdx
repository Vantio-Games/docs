## Base URL

The API base URL is:

```

```

For production, replace with your production server URL.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Include your secret API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_...
```

The API key format is `sk_` followed by your secret key. You can find your API keys in your dashboard settings.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.

## API Resources

The API is organized into the following resource groups:

- **Users** - Student directory within your programs
- **Referrals** - Signups and conversions
- **Posters** - Ambassador posters and placements
- **Impressions** - QR scans and related activity
- **Earnings** - Earnings from referrals

## Rate Limits

API rate limits apply to prevent abuse. Check response headers for rate limit information.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- `404` - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
